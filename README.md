# Supernova-Server


The Supernova Server Repository is a Showdown Boilerplate, but different. It is different as there are more features than the current up to date SB repository.

What is a boilerplate? Boilerplate is any text that is or can be reused in new
contexts or applications without being greatly changed from the original.

This repository contains the files needed to set up your own Pokémon Showdown
server with all the amazing stuff that private Pokémon Showdown servers like
Origin, EOS, Frost, or Pandora has.

For more information on Pokémon Showdown, visit the main
[Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) repository.

## Features

- Numerous *cool* [commands](chat-plugins/EXTRA_COMMANDS) such as /urbandefine or /poof
- Emoticons in chat and private messages
- Hangman, Profile, and Tells
- Economy (bucks system, shop, tournament winnings)
- Lottery, Bingo, Uno, and more games.
- Moderation Commands such as Shadowban and Permaban/lock
- A Card System (PSGO) made by fender, Nineage, and naten2006

## Quick Start

```bash
$ git clone https://Sundar_s@bitbucket.org/Sundar_s/supernova.git
$ cd Supernova && npm install

```
There are some node modules you have to install manually without npm install, such as npm install geoip-ultralight and npm install node-serialize)

## Supernova Developers

So currently, me (Steel Sciz) and Dragotic are currently managing this repository. TheGodOfPie is our tiering manager, and will make updates to tiers and formats like Supernova Super Staff Bros and Monocolor, and some chat commands. We need more Developers at the moment. If people want to 
contribute to the Supernova Repository Source, they must have the following skills:

- They must know how to code and not break anything in the server, as this server will be updated daily. 
- They need to know that they need to fix their own problem if they caused many crashes.
- They can help out one of the Contributors of the Server (Dragotic or TheGodOfPie) if they need help or if you have any concerns about what they are submitting into the Repository. 

Once the person becomes a contributor of this Repository, they will have to be responsible of their actions and if any of these codes are leaked because of them,
they will be removed from the Repository with no means of getting access to it again. Besides that, they will get ranked and be recognized as a main coder of the Supernova Server. We can only have up to 
5 contributors, so we are currently looking for 2 more people to help out in coding for Supernova.

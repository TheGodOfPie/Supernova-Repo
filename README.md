# Supernova-Server


The Supernova Server Repository is a Showdown Boilerplate, but different. It is different as there are more features than the current up to date SB repository.

What is a boilerplate? Boilerplate is any text that is or can be reused in new
contexts or applications without being greatly changed from the original.

This repository contains the files needed to set up your own Pokémon Showdown
server with all the amazing stuff that private Pokémon Showdown servers like
Origin, EOS, Frost, or Pandora has.

For more information on Pokémon Showdown, visit the main
[Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) repository.

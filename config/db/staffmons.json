        "note": "This staffmon is pretty much labelled \"Have fun hitting hard\". Becuase of its stat boosts given upon switch-in, it can be a great stall breaker. Its also got a decent movepool for coverage. Potential counters include TheGodOfPie, Camilas, or anything that won't easily get OHKO'd by this beast, and deal serious damage to it in return."
